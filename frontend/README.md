# Sentient Tracker Frontend

A React application built with Create React App, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI.

## Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The app assumes the backend API is running and reachable at `http://localhost:8000`.
You can override the URL by setting the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable when running.
